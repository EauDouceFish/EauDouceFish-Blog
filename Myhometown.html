    <h1>My Hometown----Fuzhou</h1>
    <div class="mhblock">
        <div class="mhtext">
            <p>I live in fuzhou,which is a second-tier coastal city as the capital city of Fujian Province.There are many beautiful places and scenic spots to visit in Fuzhou,
                like Nanhoujie,Shangxiahang  (Some ancient-style attractions),etc.<br>These scenic spots are good places for daily travel and relaxation. 
                In my spare time, such as weekend evenings, I often take the subway to these scenic spots with my close friends.<br>Hanging out!(joking)
                Having a drink,eat some snacks and enjoy the cool night.Fantastic!
            </p>

        <div class="mhtext">
            <p>The two pictures on the right are Nanhoujie and Shangxiahang respectively.These two wonderful places are very popular with people.
                But I am more glad to enjoy it alone--early morning,evening,or rainy days.Less people would disturb my own world.It's the time for relaxation.
                <br><br> Of course,as they are crowded it is also a fantastic scene--when the evening lights are lit,flowing with the crowd,having snacks and enjoy the
                melody of lives.Unleash your passion!

            <p>Jasminie（Called moli in Chinese）is a symbol flower of Fuzhou.It is famous for its unique and refreshing scent————not too strong，
                but to the point，making people be attracted into it.<br>Jasmine can be used to make tea,within the great scent of itself completely.
                This kind of tea is a speciality of Fujian Province.But it is widely liked. As a scented tea，Jasmine tea is very popular and drink-tasty.
                If you would like to chat with me，let me treat you with it！I'm sure that you are to be absorbed in it.

            <p>Living near the school,I spent 6 years for my study and lived in Cangshan District,where is a peaceful and beautiful place.<br>
                In the leisure time,walking along the street and enjoy the beautiful scene.Or,staying in a cafe to kill a whole afternoon.<br><br>
                This kind of slow life-style might attract anyone who comes here.However，at that time I didn't have engough time to dive into this place filled with secret.
                Really hoping to come back to here and recall my memories again.
