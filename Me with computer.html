               I have been very interested in computers since I was a child. It started out as just playing games on various electronic devices. <br>Maybe a lot of people (like me)
               consider computer science as playing games when we were children.Thus I have a strong interest in computing.<br><br>As I knew that they are quite different when I grew up，it didn’t upset me.
               I tried to learn some languages and introductory theories and got some limited knowledge in this field.Surely that I would make great progress in the future.

            <h4>For FUTURE:</h4><br>
            Planning to learn Python and Java in the future(one or two years).From basic syntax(1 year) to senior design(2 years).I'm taking the first steps.<br>
            I think Digital media technology(design games) is my directiozn.Hoping to be a great game-designer.<br>
            To access this goal,Html and HCI are also important projects.Moreover,there are many works and tasks to do.I would spare no effort in studying.<br><br>
